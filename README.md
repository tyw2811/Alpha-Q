# Alpha-Q

Alpha Q is a project that aims to be a platform that reduces food wastage in Singapore by promoting food sharing.


## Motivation

We designed and did this project for a hackathon called LifeHack, where the prompt was: "In 2019, Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food waste. How can we tackle this growing problem and encourage Singaporeans to cut down on unnecessary food waste?"

## Testing

You can test the app [here](https://alphaqlifehack.vercel.app/).

## Bugs

On the forum page, when each post is clicked, it requires a reload of the page once to load the post.

## How-To-Use

First, make an account by clicking the "GET STARTED" button or the "SIGN UP" button on the top right. Alternatively, if you have already made an account, login via the "LOGIN" button on the top right.

You will be moved to the forum page, where you can view posts by other users. Click on any of the post to view them in depth, with the image attached by the user who submitted the post. To submit a post, click on the "POST" button and enter the fields accordingly. To delete your post, first navigate to your own post, then click the "DELETE" button to delete your post, when your post has been resolved for example.

Then, you can click the map tab on the top left to navigate to the maps page. Depending on which location is selected, the list of posts and information will be displayed accordingly, getting information from the posts made by users, showing the user how much food is in need of rescue in certain areas. The map shows the general location of the area as well.

## Limitations

Currently, the locations are only limited to 4 places, and they are quite large areas. We hope to improve on this by letting the user input their postal code so that users who are interested know where to pick the food up. With this, there would be extra markers on the map showing the exact location of each post.
