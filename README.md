# Alpha-Q

Alpha Q is a project that aims to be a platform that reduces food wastage in Singapore by promoting food sharing.


## Motivation

We designed and did this project for a hackathon called LifeHack, where the prompt was: "In 2019, Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food waste. How can we tackle this growing problem and encourage Singaporeans to cut down on unnecessary food waste?"
